# adversarial_search_algorithm
Adversarial Search Algorithm Implementation.

This implementation describes an adversarial search algorithm, a common technique in game theory and artificial intelligence. The function takes three parameters and operates by recursively exploring a game tree, beginning from the current state. It alternates between maximizing and minimizing the score at each level of the tree using the Minimax algorithm. The maximizing player aims to select a move that leads to the highest possible score, while the minimizing player seeks a move that results in the lowest score. The function ultimately returns the best score found at the leaf nodes of the search tree, representing the optimal move for the maximizing player.
